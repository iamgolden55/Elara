# Elara AI - Enhanced Medical Assistant

## Overview of Recent Enhancements

We've implemented several major enhancements to the Elara AI medical assistant:

1. **Improved LoRA Training** - Created scripts to generate high-quality training data with structured formatting and train LoRA adapters for different user roles.
2. **RAG Integration** - Built a powerful Retrieval Augmented Generation system that uses your 148K+ medical articles to provide accurate, up-to-date information.
3. **Enhanced Response Formatting** - Added structured formatting to responses with sections, bullet points and clear organization.
4. **Multilingual Support** - Strengthened the multilingual capabilities through better translation integration.

## How to Use the New Features

### 1. Install Requirements

First, make sure all required packages are installed:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x install_requirements.py

# Run the installation script
python install_requirements.py
```

Choose option 4 to install all requirements.

### 2. Generate Training Data

Use the new training data generator to create high-quality examples from your medical articles:

```bash
python data/scripts/generate_training_data.py
```

This script will:
- Load your 148K+ high-quality medical articles
- Categorize them by medical topic
- Extract key information about each topic
- Generate structured Q&A pairs for both patients and medical professionals
- Save the results to JSONL files in `data/training_data/`

The generated examples will follow the structured format you provided, with sections, bullet points, and clear organization.

### 3. Train a LoRA Adapter

Now that you have high-quality training data, train a LoRA adapter:

```bash
python data/scripts/train_medical_lora.py --role patient
```

Options:
- `--role`: Choose `patient`, `professional`, or `both` to train for different user types
- `--lora_r`: LoRA rank (default: 16)
- `--epochs`: Number of training epochs (default: 3)
- `--batch_size`: Batch size (default: 4)

This will train a LoRA adapter and save it to `models_files/medical_lora/`.

### 4. Build the RAG System

To enable the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) feature:

```bash
python data/scripts/build_medical_rag.py --rebuild
```

This script will:
- Process your 148K+ medical articles
- Create embeddings for each chunk of text
- Build a FAISS vector index for fast similarity search
- Save everything to `data/rag/`

You can test the RAG system with:

```bash
python data/scripts/build_medical_rag.py --demo
```

This will let you interactively query the medical knowledge base.

### 5. Start the Backend

The backend has been updated to use both your trained LoRA model and the RAG system:

```bash
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

The server will automatically:
- Load your trained LoRA model
- Initialize the RAG system
- Enable enhanced response formatting
- Support multilingual queries

### 6. Test the Enhanced Assistant

Once the server is running, you can test the enhanced assistant:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chat/ask" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"What are the symptoms of diabetes?","user_type":"patient","language":"en","include_sources":true}'
```

You should receive a well-structured response with information retrieved from your medical articles.

## Technical Details

### LoRA Training Architecture

The LoRA training pipeline:
1. Loads the DialoGPT-medium base model
2. Applies low-rank adaptation to the attention layers
3. Trains on your generated medical Q&A examples
4. Saves the adapter weights (only ~0.5% of the full model size)

This approach is very memory-efficient, allowing fine-tuning on a single GPU or even CPU.

### RAG System Design

The RAG system works as follows:
1. When a question is received, it's converted to an embedding vector
2. The FAISS index searches for similar chunks in your medical knowledge base
3. The most relevant medical information is retrieved
4. This information is added to the prompt before generating the answer
5. The LoRA model uses this context to generate an accurate, informative response

This approach dramatically reduces hallucinations and ensures answers are grounded in real medical information.

### Response Formatting

Responses now use a structured format:
- Introduction summary
- Key information in bullet points
- Additional details when relevant
- Medical advice section
- Clear disclaimer

This format is automatically applied to ensure consistent, reader-friendly responses.

## Next Steps

Potential future enhancements:
1. Train on more diverse medical questions and answers
2. Add support for medical image analysis
3. Implement voice interface with Whisper and TTS
4. Create a web frontend for easier testing
5. Deploy as a standalone application or API service

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Model loading fails**: Ensure you have enough RAM (at least 8GB)
- **RAG system not initialized**: Check that you've built the RAG index
- **Training data generation slow**: Limit the number of articles with `--limit`
- **CUDA out of memory**: Reduce batch size or switch to CPU
- **Poor quality responses**: Generate more training data or improve RAG

For any issues, check the console logs as they contain detailed error information.
